Python script that checks directory for invalid JSONs.

# How to Run
Run this command: `python3 neelix.py`

# Tests
By default the script will check the `tests` directory. You can change this by modifying the `neelix.py` file.

# Current Build Status
Works on Mac OS 10.15.3 and Python 3.7.2

# Why does this exist? and why Neelix?
I wanted a small project to play with Python and because I like Star Trek! Also, I had to manage a project that a very large number of JSONs and I wanted to quickly validate each one (before a build process)
